# 🤝 Contributing to Vale.OS

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to this project. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## 🛠 How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs
This section guides you through submitting a bug report.
- **Use a clear title**.

### Suggesting Enhancements
This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality.

### Pull Requests
1.  Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3.  If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4.  Ensure the test suite passes.

## 🎨 Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages
*   Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
*   Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")

### TypeScript / React Style
*   We use **Functional Components** with Hooks.
*   Interfaces over Types where possible.
*   **Tailwind** for all styling. Avoid custom CSS files unless necessary.

## 🎁 Gamification Logic
If you are touching the XP/Leveling logic, please be careful. This is the core "fun" loop for users.
- `src/utils/gamification.ts` contains the core math.
- Always verify that XP is awarded *after* the optimistic update allows it.
