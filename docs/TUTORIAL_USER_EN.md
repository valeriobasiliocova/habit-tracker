## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. The Dashboard (Your Control Center)
The **Dashboard** is your landing page. It's designed to give you an immediate overview of your current state.
- **Yearly Heatmap**: Each hexagon represents a day. The brighter the color, the more productive you were. Your goal is "don't break the chain".
- **Quick Stats**: Global completion rate, perfect days, and current streak.

### 2. Setting Your Goals
The app divides goals into two categories to help you stay focused:
1.  **Macro Goals (Long Term)**: Where do you want to be in 1 year?
2.  **Habits (Weekly/Daily)**: The small daily actions that will get you there.

Navigate to the **Goals** section and click "New Goal" to start. You can assign a category (e.g., Health, Business, Study) and a color to distinguish them easily.

### 3. Gamification & Missions 🎮
To make discipline fun, we've integrated a **Mission** system.
- Earn **XP (Experience Points)** by completing your habits.
- Unlock new regions and badges on the interactive map.
- **Levels**: Level up as you maintain consistency.
